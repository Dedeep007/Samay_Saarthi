# Agentic Timetable Generator

An intelligent timetable generation system using LangChain, Groq LLM, and LangGraph for creating optimal course schedules without conflicts.

## Features

- **Intelligent Scheduling**: Uses Groq LLM (ChatGroq) to generate optimal timetables
- **Conflict Resolution**: Automatically detects and resolves scheduling conflicts
- **Faculty Workload Management**: Ensures fair distribution and prevents overloading
- **Credit Distribution**: Balances course load across days
- **Graph-based Workflow**: Uses LangGraph for structured processing pipeline

## System Components

### 1. Models (`models.py`)
- **Course**: Course information with credits, faculty, and preferences
- **Faculty**: Faculty details with workload limits and expertise
- **TimetableSlot**: Individual schedule entries
- **TimeSlot**: Time period definitions

### 2. Agents (`agents.py`)
- **TimetableAgent**: LLM-powered agent for generating and optimizing schedules
- Uses ChatGroq for intelligent decision making
- Handles initial generation, conflict resolution, and optimization

### 3. Validators (`validators.py`)
- **TimetableValidator**: Checks for scheduling conflicts
- **TimetableOptimizer**: Resolves conflicts and improves distribution
- Validates faculty time conflicts, room conflicts, and workload limits

### 4. Graph Workflow (`timetable_graph.py`)
- **TimetableGraph**: LangGraph-based workflow orchestration
- Manages the complete pipeline from generation to finalization
- Iterative conflict resolution with optimization

## Installation

1. Clone or download the project
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up your Groq API key:
   - Get API key from https://console.groq.com/
   - Add to `.env` file:
```
GROQ_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage

Run the main script with sample data:
```bash
python main.py
```

### Custom Data

Modify `custom_example.py` to use your own courses and faculty:

```python
from models import Course, Faculty, DayOfWeek
from timetable_graph import TimetableGraph

# Define your faculty
faculty = [
    Faculty(
        id="F001",
        name="Dr. John Doe",
        department="Computer Science", 
        max_hours_per_week=20,
        expertise_areas=["Programming", "AI"]
    )
]

# Define your courses
courses = [
    Course(
        code="CS101",
        name="Introduction to Programming",
        credits=4,
        department="Computer Science",
        faculty_id="F001", 
        hours_per_week=4
    )
]

# Generate timetable
timetable_graph = TimetableGraph(groq_api_key)
result = timetable_graph.generate_timetable(courses, faculty)
```

## Workflow Pipeline

```
Input (Courses + Faculty)
    â†“
1. Generate Initial Timetable (LLM)
    â†“
2. Validate for Conflicts
    â†“
3. Resolve Conflicts (if any) â†’ Back to Validate
    â†“
4. Optimize Distribution (LLM)
    â†“
5. Finalize Timetable
    â†“
Output (Optimized Schedule)
```

## Key Constraints

1. **No Faculty Conflicts**: Same faculty cannot teach multiple courses simultaneously
2. **Workload Limits**: Faculty hours don't exceed maximum weekly limit
3. **Room Conflicts**: No double-booking of rooms (if specified)
4. **Credit Balance**: Even distribution of courses across days
5. **Preference Respect**: Consider faculty and course day preferences

## Output

The system generates:
- **Formatted Timetable**: Day-wise schedule display
- **Faculty Workload Analysis**: Hours and course distribution per faculty
- **Conflict Report**: Any unresolved scheduling issues
- **JSON Export**: Machine-readable timetable data

## Example Output

```
ðŸ“… MONDAY
--------------------------------------------------
  09:00-10:00 | CS101 | Faculty: F001
  10:00-11:00 | MATH201 | Faculty: F003
  14:00-15:00 | PHY101 | Faculty: F004

ðŸ“… TUESDAY  
--------------------------------------------------
  09:00-10:00 | CS201 | Faculty: F001
  11:00-12:00 | CS401 | Faculty: F002
```

## Configuration

### Time Slots
Default time slots (modifiable in code):
- 09:00-10:00, 10:00-11:00, 11:00-12:00, 12:00-13:00
- 14:00-15:00, 15:00-16:00, 16:00-17:00

### Working Days
Default: Monday to Friday (configurable)

### LLM Model
Default: mixtral-8x7b-32768 (Groq)
- High performance for complex scheduling logic
- Can be changed in `TimetableAgent` initialization

## Advanced Features

### Custom Constraints
Extend the validator to add institution-specific rules:
```python
class CustomValidator(TimetableValidator):
    def validate_custom_rules(self, slots):
        # Add your custom validation logic
        pass
```

### Integration APIs
The system can be easily integrated into web applications:
```python
from timetable_graph import TimetableGraph

def generate_schedule_api(courses_data, faculty_data):
    # Convert data to models
    courses = [Course(**course) for course in courses_data]
    faculty = [Faculty(**f) for f in faculty_data] 
    
    # Generate timetable
    graph = TimetableGraph(api_key)
    return graph.generate_timetable(courses, faculty)
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Key Error**: Ensure GROQ_API_KEY is set correctly in .env
2. **No Slots Generated**: Check if faculty IDs match between courses and faculty
3. **Too Many Conflicts**: Reduce course load or increase faculty availability
4. **Import Errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed

### Performance Tips

- Limit courses to ~20-30 for optimal LLM performance
- Use specific day/time preferences to guide generation
- Increase faculty max_hours if schedules are too constrained

## Contributing

To extend the system:
1. Add new constraint types in `validators.py`
2. Enhance LLM prompts in `agents.py` 
3. Modify workflow in `timetable_graph.py`
4. Add new data models in `models.py`
